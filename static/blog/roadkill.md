## Dull Young-Adult Novel

```
Overall: 3 out of 5 stars
Performance: 4 out of 5 stars
Story: 2 out of 5 stars
```

Dennis E. Taylor's "Roadkill" falls short of expectations, especially for fans of his previous works like the popular Bobiverse series. While the audiobook's narration by Ray Porter is commendable, the story itself is lackluster and predictable.

The book follows Jack Kernigan, a young man who gets involved in a conspiracy of intergalactic proportions after hitting an invisible, furry creature while on a delivery. With the help of his best friends Natalie and Patrick, Jack uncovers an extraterrestrial conspiracy. Their mission to save the world is aided by a snarky AI named Sheldon and a spaceship.

While the premise of the story is intriguing, the execution is bland and unimaginative, making it best suited for young adults seeking an easy read. The characters lack depth and originality, feeling like recycled versions of characters from Taylor's previous outings. The book is also weighed down by heavy-handed political subtext that comes off as preachy and detracts from the overall enjoyment of the story.

The plot is predictable and offers little in the way of originality or exploration of interesting themes. The book serves as a forgettable, wish-fulfillment fantasy that fails to leave a lasting impression.

In conclusion, "Roadkill" is a mediocre young-adult sci-fi novel that pales in comparison to Taylor's previous works. While the narration is well done, the lackluster story and shallow characters make it a forgettable read.
