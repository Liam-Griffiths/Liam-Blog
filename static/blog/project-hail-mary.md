As a fan of Andy Weir's The Martian and Ray Porter's narrations of the Bobiverse series, I was excited to dive into Project Hail Mary. And I was not disappointed.

The story follows the journey of a lone astronaut, Ryland Grace, as he sets out to save humanity from an impending extinction-level event. The in-space portions of the book are thrilling and engrossing, with an abundance of interesting problems and solutions that kept me on the edge of my seat.

The on-ground portions of the book are equally enjoyable, providing weighty and grounded moments that never slow the pace of the story. Andy Weir has a knack for writing science fiction that is both entertaining and scientifically accurate, and Project Hail Mary is no exception.

Ray Porter's performance is excellent and consistent throughout the audiobook. He lends great depth to the character of Rocky, an alien lifeform that Ryland befriends on his journey. The sound design for Rocky is also very enjoyable and adds to the audiobook's charm.

The book's conclusion is satisfying and well developed, providing a sense of closure that left me feeling fulfilled. Overall, Project Hail Mary is a triumph for Andy Weir and a highly recommended listen for anyone who loves science fiction.
