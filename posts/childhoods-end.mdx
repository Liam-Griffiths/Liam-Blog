I was hoping for a sci-fi tale of man's first contact and Arthur C Clarke doesn't disappoint with the scope and ambition of Childhoods End. The book is split mostly into two main parts the first being the initial consequences and handling of the Overlords arrival through the pov of the Human ambassador. The second part of the book being the longer term changes to human society leading toward the ultimate reveal of the plan for humanity.

if I had to criticise the book it would the jump between the first part and second part with the dinner party scene being a boring change of pace despite the importance of this scene. Also I found Yan's stowaway plot and the new Sparta plots to be initially uninteresting, but by the conclusion, paid off well.

Overall the scope and ambition displayed here is worth listening to despite some dry patches in the middle. It more than makes up for it with an ambitious ending exploring metaphysical ideas. Both bleak and hopeful. Emotional and inspiring.

The narration was solid, easy to listen to and where appropriate accented well.
