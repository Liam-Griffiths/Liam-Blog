Proof that you don't need alien invasion and blaster riffles to make a good sci-fi novel. The imagining of the moon in it dusty form swallowing the ship whole made for some excellent sci-fi and suspense as each problem becomes evident and the urgency of the situation grow. Some charactesr were a little underdeveloped, but the story is short enough that no character over stays their welcome.

Competently narrated, with a good feel for each character.
