Unfortunately probably the weakest book released by Dennis E Taylor, Roadkill is best thought of as a Fun easy read for Teen and Young Adults.

The main issue is that it feels like all the Characters are recycled from previous, better outings by Taylor. The other issue is how shallow the main narrative is at times, interesting threads and themes left abandoned or unexplored.
