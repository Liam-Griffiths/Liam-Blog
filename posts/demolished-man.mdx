The core ideas are exquisitely laid out by Bester, this is as much SF as it is a psychological thriller. Rarely are concepts like telepathy and madness explored well in SF, but both are handled with great skill by the Author, the world he creates is interesting and integral to the story. Wonderful writing throughout, both lead characters of Reich and Powell are distinct, motivated and well executed.

My only complaint is that the final chapter is a total mess, a long exposition of what was mostly already expertly revealed in the previous chapter. We get to see a rather rushed description of demolition and a happy ending for some of the other characters before the book ends. Honestly it's a very sour note to end an otherwise brilliant book.

The Stars My Destination is superior but the demolished man delivers. The Performance of Gerard Doyle being excellent here as well, distinct character voices and a natural flow. Recommended.
