As a fan of the Martian and of the Ray Porter narrated Bobiverse books, this combination is an absolute delight. The in space portions of the book being exciting and interesting, with interesting problems and solutions. The on ground portions of the book being weighty and grounded, without ever slowing the pace of the book.

The sound design and performance for the character of rocky is very enjoyable and lends this audiobook a great deal of charm, with Ray Porters performance being excellent and consistent throughout. The book also ends in a satisfying and well developed conclusion. A triumph for Andy Weir. Highly recommended.
