## Excellent narration of a well crafted story.

```
Overall: 5 out of 5 stars
Performance: 5 out of 5 stars
Story: 5 out of 5 stars
```

A well written story of science fiction intrigue. Each step along the way unfolds in satisfying and engaging ways. The Narrator is probably the best part here, clear, consistent and distinct voices for all characters, a pleasure to listen to.

The only negative is that this book lacks much of an ending, which is unfortunate given the lackluster sequels.
