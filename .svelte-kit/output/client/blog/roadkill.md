## Dull Young-Adult Novel

```
Overall: 3 out of 5 stars
Performance: 4 out of 5 stars
Story: 2 out of 5 stars
```

Unfortunately probably the weakest book released by Dennis E Taylor, Roadkill is best thought of as an easy read for Teen and Young Adults.

The main issue is that it feels like all the Characters are recycled from previous, better outings by Taylor. The other issue is how shallow the main narrative is, interesting threads and themes left abandoned or unexplored.
